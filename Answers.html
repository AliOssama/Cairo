      <h4> Why is visualization effective? </h4>
        <p> Data visualizations are effective because most people realize the facts only when they envision the evidence.
            We are fast in detecting visual patterns and exceptions to those patterns that is why data visualization work </p>

       <h4> What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks? </h4>
       <p> Cairo mentioned the Hierarchy of Elementary Perceptual Tasks. The idea is that, the higher you reach in the hierarchy, the 
       better the data visualization is. He then gave the exact statement to answer this question which says that to create a successful
       chart, you need to think about the elementary tasks first. </p>

        <h4> What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization ? </h4> 
        <p> The first one is the purpose. If the purpose is to show big picture and details, use multiple graphic forms even though it is
        more complicated. Another one is that you cannot apply anyone else's method or ideas without critically thinking about its 
        functionality to your goal. Finally, Cairo talks about scaling and how the goal matters more than the graph rules. This includes
        graphing what we need even if its not the best option. He gave an example of graphing income and expenses separately vs together,
        he mentioned that the best option is what serves your goal. </p>
